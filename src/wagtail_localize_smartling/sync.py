    Sync the state of a Job instance with the corresponding job in Smartling.

    This uses select_for_update() to lock the Job row for the duration of the
    method. These locks are only released when the _transaction_ ends, not
    savepoints. To ensure we don't accidentally create long-lasting locks on the
    the Job rows, we pass durable=True to the atomic decorator. That means that
    this atomic() block is definitely the outermost one and the transaction will
    be committed or rolled back at the end of this function.

    NB - this takes an ID, rather than a job instance, so that it's always
    operating on current data rather than pickled state. That means it's safe
    to be called after arbitrary time from the background task queue, if one
    is in use.
